  "design-1-title": "Trust",
  "design-1-desc": "Our designs must be reliable and dependable. Trust is the heart that can be obtained when you put down your greed. Design neatly and clearly so that you can reach them without wandering, with a consistent purpose. If you are holding a hot cup, you can just let it go without saying 'It's hot', it's like asking 'how do I put it'. It's not that there's a lack of laying skills. It's hot, but I just can't let it go because I want it. If you only chase hot and trendy designs, you will lose consistency by losing the core focus, which will soon lead to loss of trust. If you can't believe it, it's as if it didn't exist.",
  "design-2-title": "Connect",
  "design-2-desc": "Connecting technology and people. And this connection should be organic and designed to give you a good experience. Connections form relationships, and we design them to be active and positive so that they can communicate seamlessly. When a dot moves, it creates energy and also leaves a trace. The traces of dots are connected from a macro perspective to become lines. Furthermore, it develops complex shapes with planes and solids. There are implicit rules of order in connected relationships. That rule is 'consideration'. Giving time and space for one point to move on to the next. It is a heart that waits and listens. For example, even seemingly insignificant parts such as shapes or colors that allow users to intuitively grasp functions, and consideration can also be considered for considering environmental, economic, and socially connected relationships. Connections can create sustainable design.",
  "design-3-title": "Growth",
  "design-3-desc": "Design is an expression of the human spirit and life and has the power to understand and interpret the times and cultures. After all, design starts from the center of human beings. However, we must recognize that humans are also part of Mother Nature and accept humility and change. We should not neglect to reinterpret and materialize the mystical phenomena of Mother Nature from the human point of view. It will be known if you ignore or overlook the basic and priority conditions that must be pre-determined because you are too obsessed with goals or results. You can grow when you abandon arrogance and prejudice and look at the world with a humble attitude. This is the beginning of endless possibilities.",
  "design-4-title": "Balance",
  "design-4-desc": "The harmony of elements of proportion, structure, styling and technology. We pursue aesthetically natural designs. Dichotomous thinking—black and white, yin and yang, good and evil—can quickly define and act on phenomena. But leaning to one side or the other will upset the balance. The harmony of the world lies in flexibility. In the dictionary meaning, soft and weak words also mean that your thoughts are soft. To expand the scope of thinking, step back and look at it from a distance and balance it. You need to distinguish what to include and what to leave out so as not to generate unnecessary attention. This will deliver a better experience without compromising or giving up the value to be delivered to the user.",
